<h1>Shiver</h1>
<h2>By: Lucy Rose</h2>

<p>And we broke<br>
Everything that was right<br>
We both enjoyed a good fight<br>
And we sewed<br>
All the holes we had to breathe<br>
To make the other one leave<br>
</p>
<p>And I loved the way you looked at me<br>
And I miss the way you made me feel<br>
When we were alone<br>
When we were alone<br>
</p>
<p>And I'll shiver like I used to<br>
And I'll leave him just for you<br>
And I'll shiver like I used to<br>
Just for you<br>
</p>
<p>And we stole<br>
Every moment we had<br>
To make the other one feel bad<br>
And we hoped<br>
That we could be what we knew<br>
It never turned out to be real<br>
</p>
<p>And I loved the way you looked at me<br>
And I miss the way you made me feel<br>
When we were alone<br>
When we were alone<br>
</p>
<p>And I'll shiver like I used to<br>
And I'll leave him just for you<br>
And I'll shiver like I used to<br>
Just for you<br>
</p>
<p>And if we turn back time<br>
Could we learn to live right?<br>
And if we turn back time<br>
Could we learn to live right?<br>
And if we turn back time<br>
Could we learn to live right?<br>
And if we turn back time<br>
Could we learn?<br>
</p>
<p>And I'll shiver like I used to<br>
And I'll leave him just for you<br>
And I'll shiver like I used to<br>
Just for you<br>
Like I used to<br>
